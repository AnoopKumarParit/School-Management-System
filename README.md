<h2>Developed a full-stack Student Management System featuring a robust backend built with Spring Boot and a dynamic frontend interface (React/HTML). The application provides role-based access for admin and students, enabling efficient management of student profiles, academic details, and administrative operations.</h2>

<h3>Key Responsibilities & Features:</h3>

Designed and implemented RESTful APIs using Spring Boot to perform CRUD operations for students, courses, and departments.

Utilized Spring Data JPA with MySQL to manage relational data and optimize database interactions.

Implemented layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository) ensuring modular, maintainable, and testable code.

Added input validation, exception handling, and global error responses for reliable and secure API behavior.

Integrated features for user authentication & authorization using Spring Security (JWT-based optional).

Enabled data pagination, sorting, and filtering to improve efficiency for large student datasets.

Collaborated with frontend (React) to deliver seamless API communication using JSON.

Tested backend modules using JUnit and MockMVC for ensuring API reliability.

Tech Stack:
Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, MySQL, Hibernate, Maven, REST APIs, React (optional), Postman.
